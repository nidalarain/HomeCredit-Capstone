This project focuses on addressing a critical challenge for Home Credit evaluating the repayment capacity of loan applicants with limited or no credit history. 
Leveraging data-driven machine learning techniques, our predictive model improves loan approval decisions while minimizing default rates. 
This work directly supports the business goal of promoting financial inclusion by enabling responsible credit access for underserved communities.


Business Problem & Objective
Problem Statement:
Loan providers face significant risk in approving applications from individuals with limited credit history. Existing methods either reject these applications outright or rely on inaccurate proxies, leading to lost opportunities or increased defaults.

Objective:
To create a supervised learning model that accurately predicts loan repayment probabilities, enabling the approval of more loans without increasing default risk.

Solution Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted thorough data exploration to identify patterns, handle missing values, and address imbalances.

Model Development:
Implemented classification models including [Random Forest, PCA + Clustering, XGBoost, Neural Networks] to predict repayment probabilities.

Evaluation Metrics:
Focused on precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robustness in assessing loan applicants.

Key Features:
Engineered features like [e.g., income-to-loan ratio, employment stability index], improving model interpretability and accuracy.

Contributions

My Role:
As a core contributor, I:
Conducted an individual exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, uncovering insights into variable relationships, data quality issues, and missing values. My group and I then convened to compare findings, which helped shape our modeling strategy.

Collaborated with the group to divide up the modeling tasks, with each member experimenting with different machine learning techniques to identify the model achieving the best Kaggle score.

Focused on developing and fine-tuning a Random Forest model, which achieved a Kaggle score of 0.54218, making it the third-best performing model in our group.
Produced detailed visualizations, documented findings in a reproducible R Markdown report, and contributed insights to the groupâ€™s overall model evaluation and selection process.
